			<h2>Realtime Fractals</h2>
			<h3>HISTORY OF JAME</h3>
			<p>My name is <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/andreamedeghini">Andrea Medeghini</a>. I began working on JAME in 2000, when I was a student at University. I continued to rework my software year after year until 2008 when I completed JAME 6. After this release I planed to continue adding new features, but since 2009 I have been very busy with other projects and I couldn't delivery new releases after 2010. The source code hasn't been maintained for long time since then, but last September 2014 I began reworking my software. I decided to deliver the last maintenance release of JAME in 2015 and then continue working on a fresh new project which will soon replace JAME.</p>
